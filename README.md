ECE 287 Project

Password Cracker

Team 7

Aidan Quimby and Taylor Owens

Our idea for the project is to make a password cracker. You would input the password via a USB keyboard, and the inputted password would be outputted to a display connected via VGA. The display would have a realtime guess count and timer.
In order to complete the project we would need to learn how to crack a basic password and then we would need to learn how to take input via the keyboard for user specified passwords. Next, we would need to learn how to generate a graphic display of the feedback data and export the data out the VGA port in realtime to the monitor.

Possible Expansions:
-Try to rate the inputted password with estimated strength
-Implement different algorithms
-Add calculations on screen for how long cracking the password on other consumer hardware (like specific CPUs or GPUs) would take
-Input multiple passwords at a time via a USB/ethernet connection to a PC/microcontroller
-Scale algorithm as large as possible for our FPGA
